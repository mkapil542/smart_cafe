Smart CTS Cafe System - Multi-Cafe & Menu Documentation
========================================================

Overview
--------
This app now supports three separate cafes (Cafe I, Cafe II, Cafe III), each with its own menu and order management. Users select a cafe from the main window, and all actions (ordering, staff management, searching) use the selected cafe's menu and orders file.

Cafe Selection
--------------
- On startup, the app shows buttons for Cafe I, Cafe II, and Cafe III.
- After selecting a cafe, the main menu appears for that cafe.

Menu Files
----------
- Each cafe has its own menu file:
  - `menu_cafeI.json`: 10 coffee shop items
  - `menu_cafeII.json`: 10 fast food items
  - `menu_cafeIII.json`: 10 Indian snacks & drinks
- The app loads the correct menu file based on the selected cafe.

Order Files
-----------
- Each cafe has its own orders file:
  - `orders_cafeI.json`
  - `orders_cafeII.json`
  - `orders_cafeIII.json`
- Orders are saved and managed separately for each cafe.

Customer & Staff Modules
------------------------
- When a cafe is selected, both customer and staff modules use the correct menu and orders file.
- The customer order screen and staff dashboard reflect the selected cafe's menu and orders.

How to Add/Change Menu Items
----------------------------
- Edit the appropriate menu file (`menu_cafeI.json`, `menu_cafeII.json`, `menu_cafeIII.json`) to update items and prices.
- Each menu file is a JSON array of objects: `{ "item": "Item Name", "price": Price }`

How to Add/Change Cafes
-----------------------
- To add a new cafe, create a new menu and orders file, and update the app's cafe selection logic.

How the Code Works
------------------
- The main app passes the selected cafe to customer and staff modules.
- The modules load the correct menu and orders file using the selected cafe name.
- All order, search, and staff actions are isolated per cafe.

This structure allows easy management and reporting for multiple cafes, each with its own menu and orders.
